# WeatherPrediction

___

This Weatherprediction app allows users to view the weekly weather forecast for the seattle area. The user can also
view the weather for a specific day in the custom forecast menu.

# How it works

---

This app uses the dataset located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthr1/weather-prediction). First the
given dataset is cleaned and then the model is trained with the significant features using a random forest classifier.
The goal is to predict the weather condition(rain, snow, fog/cloudy, etc.) given only a date.


# Roadmap

___

future iterations of weatherprediction will implement the following:
* a new web design
* train the model on a better dataset
* finetune the new model
